# Welcome to the Delegate Registry!

In this repository, we aim to create a comprehensive directory for individuals and organizations in the [Substrate](https://substrate.io) ecosystem to share their delegator information in [Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/)'s agile delegation interface. 

## How it looks like

Here are a few examples of how your information could be displayed in the directory:

</br>
<details>
  <summary>Nova Wallet app screens</summary>

<img src="./images/add_delegation.PNG" width="300">
<img src="./images/delegate_info.PNG" width="300">
<img src="./images/long_desription.PNG" width="300">

</details>
</br>

Note: These are just examples, and your actual format may vary.


## Sharing your information

To share your information, please create a JSON file with the following format:

```javascript
{
    "address": string, //substrate address in ss58 format
    "name": string, // Your title / display name which will appear in the list
    "image": string, // link to your relevant image (such as your profile picture),
    "shortDescription": string, // a brief description, no more than 256 characters long,
    "longDescription": string, // a long description that can be more than 256 characters in length, supports markdown syntax,
    "isOrganization": bool
}
```


- `address`: Your Substrate address in [ss58 format](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/learn/address-format).
- `name`: Your name or the name of your organization (display name).
- `image`: A link to an image that represents you or your organization. It should be in `.png` format and should be stored in [this repo](./images)
- `shortDescription`: A short description of yourself or your organization (no more than 256 characters).
