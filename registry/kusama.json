By voting on behalf of the long-time Dotsama community we strive to ensure that all votes we cast reflect the true best interests of our native ecosystem.\n\n![ChaosDAO Manifesto image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosDAO-org/ChaosDAO_docs/main/.gitbook/assets/ChaosDAO_Manifesto_600px.jpg)",

You can find out more about this setup [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqY6yU-YLO0).\n\n## Voting Methodology\nI typically have been delegating most of my voting power to ChaosDAO – however, depending on the interest of the community to delegate to me, I will vote independently also, and will likely follow a similar direction to that of ChaosDAO.",
