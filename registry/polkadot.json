Our members are involved with every aspect of the ecosystem as developers, community organizers, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChaosDAO) and YouTube educators, and as ordinary retail investors.\n\n## Voting Process\nAs part of our own organizationâ€™s evolution we have developed a robust [internal governance mechanism](https://github.com/ChaosDAO-org/ChaosDAO_docs/blob/main/governance/OpenGov.md) to determine how our community will publicly vote on referenda. By voting on behalf of the long-time Dotsama community we strive to ensure that all votes we cast reflect the true best interests of our native ecosystem.\n\n![ChaosDAO Manifesto image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosDAO-org/ChaosDAO_docs/main/.gitbook/assets/ChaosDAO_Manifesto_600px.jpg)",

To this day, we have more than 200 articles and reviews published with more than 1500 followers on our [Medium](https://polkadotters.medium.com/)! But not only that, we are also one of the first community validators on both Polkadot and Kusama. Besides being active on the relay chain, we also run collators on most of the parachains, founded [DOT Validator Alliance](https://dotvalidators.org/) and recently became members of [United Bloc](https://unitedbloc.com/) and [IBP](https://dotters.network/).\n As we are quite active in the ecosystem, governance is our true passion and we take our job really seriously - and given our experience activities, we believe that we are quite suitable for the job.",
