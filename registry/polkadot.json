Our members are involved with every aspect of the ecosystem as developers, community organizers, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChaosDAO) and YouTube educators, and as ordinary retail investors.\n\n## Voting Process\nAs part of our own organizationâ€™s evolution we have developed a robust [internal governance mechanism](https://github.com/ChaosDAO-org/ChaosDAO_docs/blob/main/governance/OpenGov.md) to determine how our community will publicly vote on referenda. By voting on behalf of the long-time Dotsama community we strive to ensure that all votes we cast reflect the true best interests of our native ecosystem.\n\n![ChaosDAO Manifesto image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosDAO-org/ChaosDAO_docs/main/.gitbook/assets/ChaosDAO_Manifesto_600px.jpg)",
